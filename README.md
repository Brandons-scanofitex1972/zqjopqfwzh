Just walked out of The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, and my head's still spinning like that cursed carousel from my childhood nightmares. The theater was a zoo — sticky floors from spilled soda, popcorn kernels doing the tango in my sneakers. I really needA better shoes. Watery-eyed from the damn 3D glasses pressing my nose, or maybe the dragon fights were too epic? Those sirens, man, they were like mermaids on a bad hallucinogenic trip. Can't shake off the creepy lullaby they sang, sticking in my head like a gum under school desks.

> Geralt's brooding was THICK, like a London fog but with more abs. That scene under the moonlight — where was it, some ancient ruin or my grandma's attic with more ambiance? — felt like Baudelaire poetry but made for TV generation lost on Twitter. Though, the amount of slow-motion was a bit on Michael Bay side, just minus the explosions. Though a part of me wished there were some explosions too.

Raining outside, or is it just me dripping fantasy sweat? They should have handed out towels. My back's protesting this whole sitting for 2.5 hours ordeal, the same rebellion it stages after family road trips. But the ocean scenes, man, they made me wanna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to scrub through frame by frame like a pirate scanning a treasure map. Someone asked if it's worth it to just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   at home. Maybe with noise-cancelling headphones? The theater's sound system was like a concert of overenthusiastic elephants.

Yennefer's gown was so glittery it probably has its own satellite. At one point, I thought a popcorn kernel wedged itself behind my retina, but it was just the opulent visuals. They dialed everything up to eleven — if you squint, each costume could double as a music festival tent. Oh, that part with the dolphins, or they were whales?—didn't expect to get misty-eyed, but here we are, emotions like unplugged wires sparking randomly.
